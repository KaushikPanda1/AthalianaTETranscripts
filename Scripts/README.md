The spliceCalculator.pl program takes 3 inputs and outputs splicing accuracy calculations to STDOUT, ready to be plotted in R.

Syntax:
  perl spliceCalculator.pl samtoolsDepthFile  gffFile factor > output.tab
  
  samtoolsDepthFile:  The depth file generated by samtools depth with coverage information for each nucleotide in the genome. This file can be for RNA-seq, long-read sequecing or sRNA sequencing.
  
  gffFile: This is a standard GFF file for mRNAs and exon molecules with 2 additional columns.
    1st additional column is the mRNA number or the exon number.
    2nd additional column is the number of exons in the corresponding mRNA.
    
  factor: How many nucleotides away from the splice-site should be factored in to calculate the number of inaccurately spliced transcripts. For example, a factor value of 25 would mean, all transcripts that are spliced within 25 nucleotides of the actual splice site, but not at the exact splice site (as per the GFF file) are considered inaacurately spliced transcripts.
  
  Updates coming soon:
    1. The R file to plot the splicing accuracy calculations
    2. The program to convert standard GFF files to modified GFF file that can be used by this program
